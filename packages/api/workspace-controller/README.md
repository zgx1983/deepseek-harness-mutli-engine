# Workspace Controller

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

`@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-controller` owns the Host `ctx.workspaceController` service and the generated Client `ctx.remote.workspace` namespace. Its Remote methods create, rename, remove, and reorder Workspaces, reorder Sessions within a Workspace, archive and unarchive Sessions from Workspace navigation, and follow the complete Workspace projection. Use it through API Gateway when a Client must change or follow Workspace navigation. The package also owns `ctx.directoryPickerController` and the generated `ctx.remote.directoryPicker` namespace, because the directory-picking seam it carries is abstract and never a Loader entry of its own.

## Use this package

The Host controller serializes mutations whose correctness depends on current registry state and throws `RemoteError` with a stable error code for expected failures. Its `follow()` stream synchronously attaches to durable Workspace changes, emits one complete baseline first, then emits ordered `upsert`, `remove`, `order`, `archived`, and `pinned` increments. Archive and pin sets are Session id arrays, with the most recently pinned id first in the pin array. A reconnect starts another generation with a replacement baseline, so consumers do not depend on receiving every increment while disconnected. `archiveSession` without `stopActivity` refuses a Session with running work as `workspace/session-active`, whose details list that work by family (`turn`, `subagent`, `job`, `schedule`) with item ids and labels; with `stopActivity: true` the registry's providers stop the work first and the response arrives once the archive set is durable, while the stops settle in the background. An archive request may also set `summarizeToChangelog: true`: the Host restores the Session through the Session controller, preserving its selected native, Codex, or Claude engine and native conversation identity. It submits one ordinary follow-up directing the engine to use its file or shell tools to append 3–5 short Markdown bullets to the owning Workspace root's absolute `CHANGELOG.md` path. The prompt preserves existing content, creates a missing file, supplies an exact timestamped heading with the Session id, and limits edits to that file. The prompt, answer, and engine usage remain in the original Session log. With `stopActivity: true`, summary admission first requests provider stops and waits for the Agent to become idle; queued messages refuse summary admission. After the summary turn becomes idle, the Host holds Agent maintenance while flushing the turn, reading the file, verifying the expected heading and a non-empty summary body within the character limit, and committing archival. Follow-ups cannot start another turn during verification or archive admission; queued messages reject archival, and unrelated provider activity still requires stop confirmation. The Host performs no changelog writes. Concurrent archive requests for the same Session share one operation, and an already-archived Session generates no additional summary. Failed turns, cancellation, missing entries, or excessive summary length leave the Session unarchived; changes already made by the engine remain in the file. A deadline requests cancellation and waits for the Agent to settle.

The Client entry provides `ClientWorkspaceModel` and `createWorkspaceStateStream()`. The model owns Workspace rows, registry order, archived and pinned Session identities, unary mutation echoes, and stream/unary race resolution. A newer Host row wins by `updatedAt`; a committed stream order outranks an older unary response; a removed Workspace id cannot be resurrected by delayed data. Pin snapshots change only when their identities or order change. The package exposes framework-neutral snapshots and subscriptions, leaving navigation policy and React hooks to the UI owner. `WorkspaceController.archiveSession(sessionId, { stopActivity })` throws `WorkspaceArchiveError` with the Host's `rpcError`, so a surface can tell the running-work refusal from a missing Session or a carrier fault and offer to stop the work.

### First-use Workspace

`workspace.initializeDefault()` returns the durable default Workspace; the Client service exposes it as `workspaces.initializeDefault(signal?)`. It takes no request: the Host owns the fixed `default-workspace` directory name, and the registry derives the initial title from that same segment, so one installation keeps one on-disk path and one stored title in every language. The Host places the directory under its account's `<Documents>/deepseek-harness`, including on remote Web hosts. OS filename restrictions apply. Linux system lookup requires `xdg-user-dir` with an enabled Documents directory; hosts without it must configure `documentsDirectory` or use the folder picker.

The [Workspace registry](../../workspace/workspace/README.md#first-use-workspace) owns eligibility, directory creation, and durable initialization. An existing default Workspace is returned without another Documents lookup and is never renamed or relocated. Ineligible first use returns `undefined`, so startup can leave directory selection to the user. Lookup and creation failures use standard Remote error handling. Initialization creates no Session and sends no message.

`DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY` and `workspaceDisplayTitle(title, localizedDefault)` are published from `./default-workspace` for browser consumers: a Workspace still carrying the automatic title reads as the reader's localized default name, and every other title reads verbatim. A Workspace the user renamed to exactly `default-workspace` — or a folder of that name adopted from the picker — is labeled as the default; nothing else depends on the distinction.

| Configuration | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `documentsDirectory` | System Documents directory | Fully qualified Host directory override |
| `documentsLookupTimeoutMs` | `10000` | Positive maximum duration of OS directory lookup, in milliseconds |
| `changelogSummaryMaxCharacters` | `800` | Maximum Unicode characters accepted in the appended summary body |
| `changelogSummaryTimeoutMs` | `120000` | Duration before requesting summary cancellation, in milliseconds |

Documents lookup holds the registry mutation queue, so other Workspace mutations, including registration of a picked directory, can wait up to `documentsLookupTimeoutMs`. Cancellation can stop the lookup; after resolution succeeds, it does not roll back creation or registration.

## Model Experience

Ordinary Workspace organization sends no model input. An opted-in archive submits a summary prompt as one logged follow-up in the original Session; the engine generates the summary without creating another conversation. The prompt asks the engine to write brief project-history bullets to the specified absolute changelog path with its ordinary file or shell tools; existing tool permissions apply.

#### KV Cache effect

Summary generation continues the existing engine conversation without copying history into a separate prompt. Cache reuse depends on the engine and provider; ordinary archives send no model request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- `follow()` replaces the whole projection after reconnect and has no durable cursor or incremental catch-up protocol.
- Process-local deletion markers prevent delayed data from reviving a removed Workspace only for the lifetime of the Client model.

None.

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. Workspace Registry owns persistence; every stream generation is a full projection.
